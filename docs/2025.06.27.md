## This Week's Progress
### **TODO**
- [x] Fix a bug in the `distanceBetween` function
- [ ] Test with larger datasets to ensure performance and memory usage are acceptable.  
- [ ] Create a comprehensive set of test data.

### **Fixed a bug in the `distanceBetween` function**

**Issue:**  
When calculating the distance between two nodes (e.g., `"目"` and `"毛"`), the computation did not terminate and resulted in `exit status 137`.

**Cause:**  
The `.edges` file contained self-referencing edges (i.e., lines where the parent and child were identical), which led to an infinite loop during tree traversal.

**Fix:**  
Added logic in the `loadEdges` function to filter out self-loop entries during edge loading.

```haskell
loadEdges :: 
  FilePath -> -- path to the edges file
  IO [(String, String)] -- load edges from the file
loadEdges path = do
  contents <- readFile path
  let pairs = map parseEdge (filter (not . null) (lines contents))
      filteredPairs = filter (\(p, c) -> p /= c) pairs  -- filter out self-loops
  return filteredPairs
```

**Result:**
With a dataset of 10,000 lines:    

Before the fix:
```haskell
exit status 137
```

After the fix:
```haskell
Path A: entity -> 長所 -> 利巧 -> 聰明 -> 裁き -> 目
Path B: entity -> 鬢 -> 毛
Distance between 目 and 毛: 7


Path A: entity -> 色 -> 女
Path B: entity -> 繋合せる -> 付着 -> 貼る
Distance between 女 and 貼る: 5
```
