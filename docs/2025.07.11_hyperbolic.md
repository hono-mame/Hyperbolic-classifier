## This Week's Progress

### **TODO**
- [x] investigate hyperbolic embedding implementation
- [x] list up tasks
- [x] Survey papers to read
- [x] Survey websites about Poincaré Embedding


### **Papers of Poincare Embedding**
- Poincaré Embeddings for
Learning Hierarchical Representations  
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08039.   
This paper is the original source, so I need to understand all of it.

- Tried to implement Poincare Embedding.   
http://www.tani.cs.chs.nihon-u.ac.jp/g-2018/ML_PE/poincare.pdf.   
Although they haven't reached the implementation stage, it looks like it will be a good aid for understanding the theory.

### **survey websites about Poincaré Embdding**

Is the section I should implement this time "link prediction in graphs"?    
It seems I'll need to read this part of the paper carefully.  
🌟Learning is more effective when data with hierarchical or graph structures is embedded into a Riemannian manifold called hyperbolic space.         
🌟I want to create an embedding where the distance is short if an edge exists between nodes (i.e., a parent-child relationship is established), and the distance is long if no edge exists.          
🌟It can also quantify things like the semantic similarity between words
